\section{Basic product association recommenders ~$^{Video~2.1}$}

Which product to buy with a product $X$? 
We consider \emph{non-personalized} recommendations,
which are the same for every user looking at a particular product.

\subsection{Looking for things that co-occur}

We know that a person bought $X$. Which product $Y$ to recommend?

The simplest way to compute the ranking of a product $Y$:

$\text{percentage of $X$-buyers who also bought $Y$ : }
\dfrac{\text{people who bought both $X$ and $Y$}}
{\text{people who bought $X$}}$

\emph{When it doesn't work}: in a supermarket, almost everyone buys bananas---that doesn't mean that we should recommend buying bananas to accompany every product.

\subsection{Looking where opinions diverge from the community average}

We know that a person bought $X$. Which product $Y$ to recommend?

Let $!X$ be the case when the user did not buy the product $X$. Let's look whether $X$ makes appearance of $Y$ to be more likely than in the case of $!X$.

Ranking of a product $Y$:  
$\dfrac{\dfrac{X\text{ and }Y}{X}}
{\dfrac{!X\text{ and }Y}{!X}}$ 

This excludes bestsellers from our recommendations.
